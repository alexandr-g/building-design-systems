### Contributing

PRs are welcome. I love finding new awesome resources that would shed light on the topic of Design Systems. Create a PR if you think something is worth sharing.

A few **qualities** that are appealing the most for me when adding resources:

1. Quality - should be well written
2. Be up to date
